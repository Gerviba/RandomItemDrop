##How to configure?
Put the jar file into the plugins folder and start your server. After it loaded, it will generate the config files and disable the plugin. You need to open the 'Lang.yml' in the 'plugins/RandomItemDrop' folder and set the values. After that, you should set the coordinates of the items in the 'ItemInfos.yml' at the same location. You will see something like that:

```
	- world, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, GOLD_INGOT, 35.125
	- world, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, #266, 35.125
```

The parameters are:
 * The World
 * The X coordinate
 * The Y coordinate
 * The Z coordinate
 * The Material of the droped item OR #<id of the item>
 * The Money what the picker gets

If you've finished, you can start your server and enjoy the plugin! Have fun!
